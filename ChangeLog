	* Makefile.PL:
	solaris -R kludge detection extended to cxcparam libs as well as
	Perl's

	When checking for -R's to work around ld ignoring LD_RUN_PATH if
	there's a -R, the libs for cxcparam weren't checked. This broke
	things when compiling against a Perl with no -R's in
	$Config{lddlflags}.

	* Makefile.PL:
	fix for redhat's non-default ExtUtils::MakeMaker behavior

	red hat turns off the automatically generated LD_RUN_PATH, which
	causes the build to fail. re-enable it.

2005-06-20 16:53  dj

	* Param.xs: added support for levels to paramerr handling.

	  the C::L::Param object is now a structure rather than a simple
	  paramfile.  this was implemented to handle per-object storage. it
	  isn't currently used.

	  level 0 paramerr calls are not fatal but were treated as such.
	  they are now printed to stderr, as cxcparam uses them only when a
	  query is made.

	* t/bool.t: added more tests to check if PL_sv_yes and PL_sv_no get
	  converted correctly.

2005-06-14 12:47  dj

	* Param.xs: yet another attempt at getting pset to correctly
	  interpret boolean values. the difficulty is that "boolean"
	  strings (i.e. yes/no) should be passed through, while things that
	  might be real Perl booleans should be converted to strings.

	* Param.xs: moved all error handling into XSUB code; now just
	  croaks() instead of doing the funky magic of tied hashes, etc.
	  which was way too over engineered and caused bad things to happen
	  when called during Perl's cleanup routine.

	  set now pays attention to whether the parameter is a boolean, in
	  which case it will automatically convert from Perl's version of
	  boolean to cxcparam's string version.

2005-06-14 11:06  dj

	* lib/CIAO/Lib/Param.pm: greatly simplified exception handling by
	  creating exception object in XSUB.  got rid of over-engineered
	  tied scalar for errno, as it was causing errors upon object
	  destruction in Perl cleanup when the object wasn't explicitly
	  destroyed before the end of the program.

2005-06-10 09:18  dj

	* Param.xs: extra arguments to open were being written off the end
	  of the argument array leading to segv's.

	  the actual pointer to the argv data was passed, rather than a
	  copy.  if the parameter library were to change those data, then
	  bad things might happen.  a copy is now passed
