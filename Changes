Revision history for Perl extension CIAO::Lib::Param.

0.06  Tue Sep 19 10:20:47 EDT 2006
        - minor cleanups
	- fix compilation on systems that don't have ncurses
	- redhat systems have non-standard ExtUtils::MakeMaker setup; 
	  workaround it

0.05  Mon Jun 20 16:54:12 EDT 2005

	- level 0 errors to paramerr are non-fatal but were being
	  treated as fatal.  they are now printed to stderr as
	  cxcparam uses them only in areas where a terminal is assumed
	  to be present.  kludgy, but it works for now.


0.04  Tue Jun 14 12:50:13 EDT 2005
	- one more try to get the set() method to properly distinguish
          Perl booleans from strings so that boolean strings ('yes',
          'no') are passed through while Perl booleans are converted
          to strings.
	- added pquery() class method

0.03  Tue Jun 14 11:48:19 EDT 2005
	- set() now automatically converts from Perl booleans to the
	  string form required by cxcparam.

	- the internal mechanism used to report errors was rewritten;
	  it was too complicated and caused problems when a Param object
	  was destroyed during the cleanup phase.

0.02  Fri Jun 10 09:02:17 EDT 2005

        - can now pass extra arguments to pget, as in new.

	- passing of extra arguments to paramopen was done incorrectly,
	  leading to segv's

	- now supports paramopen's two methods of supplying a
          parameter file name.

0.01  Fri Apr  8 11:00:15 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-O -n CIAO::Lib::Param -x --omit-constant -A parameter_perl.h
