Revision history for Perl extension CIAO::Lib::Param.

0.03  Tue Jun 14 11:48:19 EDT 2005
	- set() now automatically converts from Perl booleans to the
	  string form required by cxcparam.

	- the internal mechanism used to report errors was rewritten;
	  it was too complicated and caused problems when a Param object
	  was destroyed during the cleanup phase.

0.02  Fri Jun 10 09:02:17 EDT 2005

        - can now pass extra arguments to pget, as in new.

	- passing of extra arguments to paramopen was done incorrectly,
	  leading to segv's

	- now supports paramopen's two methods of supplying a
          parameter file name.
