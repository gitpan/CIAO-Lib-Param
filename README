CIAO-Lib-Param version 0.01
===========================

CIAO::Lib::Param is a Perl interface to the parameter library
(cxcparam) shipped with the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observa-
tions (CIAO) software package.  It implements an interace to IRAF
(Image Reduction and Analysis Facility) style parameter files.


INSTALLATION

This module can use either the cxcparam library in the CIAO
distribution, or a standalone version (see RESOURCES).  Several
scenarios are possible, some of which require preliminary steps before
issuing the standard commands:

   * To compile against the CIAO library, ensure that you are in the
     CIAO environment (i.e. type "ciao" or whatever alias you have set
     up).

   * If you are using the standalone library, and pkg-config is 
     available on your system, no further preliminary steps are
     required.

   * If all else fails, try specifying the following
     environmental variables:

	CXCPARAM_LIBS    the link flags required for the library
	CXCPARAM_INCS    the C preprocessor flags required to find the
			 header files
	CXCPARAM_DEFS	 any additional compile definitions.

and then proceed with the standard steps:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install



DEPENDENCIES

Without the cxcparam library (see RESOURCES), this module is nigh on
to useless.  This module requires this additional Perl module:

     File::Path


COMPATIBILITY

This module has been tested against the CIAO 3.2.1 cxcparam library on
the following systems:

      32bit Solaris 2.8
      32bit Linux Debian sarge
      32bit Linux Debian sid
      32bit Linux Fedora Core 2
